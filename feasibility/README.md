# Feasibility test pages

Temporary, hand-written browser pages that answer the version 1 feasibility questions of `docs/SPEC.md` (design: [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-24-feasibility-tests-design.md`](../docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-24-feasibility-tests-design.md)). The answers go into the spec; the pages are evidence only and are deleted at the end of the `feasibility` branch.

## Build

```sh
npm run feasibility
```

Empties and rebuilds `dist/feasibility/` and prints each written path. The builder (`scripts/feasibility-pages.ts`) inlines the scripts a page names in `data-inline`, computes their CSP hashes and inserts the policy as a meta tag.

## Run

Open a page from disk in each browser, with a fresh profile so no earlier setting changes the result:

```sh
firefox-esr --no-remote --profile "$(mktemp -d)" <file>
firefox --no-remote --profile "$(mktemp -d)" <file>
chromium --user-data-dir="$(mktemp -d)" <file>
```

Click "Copy results" on the page and paste the Markdown into the chat.
